# ‚ú® Spack build quality review tools

## üåÖ Introduction on using the GitHub CLI (`gh`)

Quick start:

- Install `gh` using `spack install gh` or any other means: <http://cli.github.com>
- Run `gh auth login`: The URL it tries to open into your browser and login
- In your `spack` checkout directory:
- Run `gh pr checkout <PR number>` for checking out a PR to review.
- Run `gh pr review --approve -b "Tested in my environment"` to approve a PR
- Run `gh pr merge --auto --squash` to merge it (enables auto-merge if not ready yet)
- Get a list of PRs that need review, are not drafts, have no assignee, are not failed
  do not have a number o labels, are not reviewed by me and have maximum comment:

  ```py
  gh pr list -L9 --search 'review:required draft:false no:assignee -status:failure -label:changes-requested -label:waiting-on-maintainer -label:waiting-on-dependency -label:question'`
  ```

## üìù Tools for checking pull request quality

### Helpful shortcuts (aliases) for `gh`

- `co`: Checkout a PR branch using fzf (select from list)

  ```py
  gh alias set co --shell 'id="$(gh pr list -L60 | fzf | cut -f1)"; [ -n "$id" ] && gh pr checkout "$id"'
  ```

- `review`: Find and check PRs that need review

  ```py
  gh alias set review --shell 'id="$(gh pr list -L20 -S "review:required draft:false no:assignee -status:failure -label:changes-requested -label:waiting-on-maintainer -label:waiting-on-dependency"|fzf|cut -f1)"; [ -n "$id" ] && gh pr checkout $id && gh pr view -c && gh pr diff'
  ```

### ‚ö°Ô∏è [`build_pr_changes.py`](build_pr_changes.py)

Run the script
[build_pr_changes.py](build_pr_changes.py)
found in this repository to install the changes of the PR checked out.

It depends on `gh` to be set up and the PR checked out with `gh pr checkout <PR number>`.
With it, it:

- Gets the PR diff using `gh pr diff`
- Looks for changed and new versions in the PR diff to install
- Looks for changed and new variants in the PR diff to install
- Checks the checksums of all changed and new versions before the build.
- Can also build all versions of recipes if indicated.
- Build each version and variant found from the diff and report the result.
- The result is ready to be pasted into a Pull request review.
- In the future, it could even submit the review directly using the `gh` CLI.

## ü™ü `gh dash`

‚ú® A GitHub (`gh`) CLI extension to display a dashboard with
**pull requests** and **issues** by
[GitHub filters](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests)
you care about.

It can be configured for the needs of spack
[spack pull requests](https://github.com/spack/spack/pulls) as well.

Using the example configuration, the key binding `b` checks out the
selected PR, and starts a sub-shell.

In the shell with the PR checked out, you can run
[build_pr_changes.py](build_pr_changes.py) to build the PR and submit the results.

See [gh-dash/README.md](gh-dash/README.md) for an introduction.
