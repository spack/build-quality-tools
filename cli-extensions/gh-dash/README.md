# gh-dash

‚ú® A GitHub (`gh`) CLI extension to display a dashboard
with **pull requests** and **issues** by
[GitHub filters](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests)
you care about.

It can be configured for the needs of spack
[spack pull requests](https://github.com/spack/spack/pulls) as well.

See [config.yml](config.yml) for an example config that sets the
spack repository path to `~/spack` and gives you a selection of
filters for PRs to use when reviewing PRs.

The default configuration has some useful key bindings:

- `d` displays the diff of the PR like `gh pr diff` would do for the selected PR.
- `v` opens an editor in the right lower corrner for approving the PR.
- `m` opens a confirmation message (Y/n) for merging the PR.
- `q` and `ESC` cancel or quit the current action.

Using the example configuration, I added one useful feature:

- `b` checks out the selected PR, and starts a Bash sub-shell.
  - TODO: When doing so, save any uncommitted changes to a sub-branch and restore it afterwards

This all feels very `vi`-like, and `git diff` can be spiced up by configuring
it to use [delta](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/introduction.html):

For proper glyphs for the pull request status in `gh dash`,
install a [Nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com)!

Here is a demo of how `gh dash` should look with one with a [Nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com):
